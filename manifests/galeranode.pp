#Defines a galera group node.
#Requires a storeconfigs backend (puppetdb, etc.) to be setup
#Options:
#[cluster_name] The name of the galera group you are going to add this node to.
#[ipaddress] The IP address to use to actually connect to the server. This could ALSO be a separate
#hostname. By default it's the primary IP on the system/server.
#[order] The default order to use. Defaults to 11, but this will likely need to be changed for additional groups.
#[galeraconfig] You probably shouldn't touch this.
